                <p>
                    Thanks for dropping by! I made this site in September 2022 as a way to practice the skills learned during my Web Development Foundations class at WGU. After I put the first bits of HTML together, I realized this would be a good personal branding site, both in terms of demonstrating my ability to self-teach and learn, but to also share who I am.

                    I'm mostly self-taught when it comes to computing, the majority of the knowledge that I've developed over the years has been a result of my own curiosity, drive, and research. This website has been two years in the making, starting with a thought that has now led to action. You'll notice this website appears very basic, and that's because my HTML and CSS skills are also very basic. As I learn new things or find new ways to present this site, you'll see changes to how everything here is displayed. I'll also be implementing a changelog page, where you can follow along with the changes and see what I've been up to. The goal is to eventually make this site fully dynamic, mobile-friendly, and accessible.

                <p>
                    I'm a tech enthusiast who has developed a life-long passion for all things technology. If it beeps or boops, has bits and bytes, and does cool (or mundane) things, I want to know about it. I've been in customer service since I was 17, working in retail, restaurants, security, fire safety, and tech. I'm a passionate learner and educator, ingesting knowledge and using it to enrich the work experience of others. I'm a team player and a team builder, an excellent communicator, and a self-starter.

                <h2 id="goal">What do I want to do?</h2>
                <p>My end goal in Cybersecurity is to start my own firm, consulting with small businesses who don't have the budget to afford the big companies, helping them secure their networks and data, as well as building good security practices in their day to day operations.</p>
                <p>My interim goals are to level up my technical skills and move into either a SOC environment or into SIEM engineering, helping tune SIEM systems with good detection rules, identifying excessive noise, and reducing alert fatigue.</p>
